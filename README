This is just a simple script using python to download programmes from BBC Redux (http://www.bbcredux.com).

At the moment it's not terribly sophisticated but will download entire series and particular 
programmes for particular days

It will search for a programme title or do a full text search. media formats can be sepcified in a config file.
